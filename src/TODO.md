# TODO
- Add dynamic references to create geometry section. Every telemetry data entry should get assigned a number that could be referenced in the section using something like $# (e.g. $1, $2) so it is possible create dynamic entities. This will be especially useful with points and segments.
- Add import (hierarchy) entities button below import blitz button.
- Add export (selected hierarchy) entities button to the left side, besides create group button.
- Add more functionality to the trails section:
    - Allow to turn all the current trail points into entities (dots and segments). they are all grouped in a single group.
    - Add displaying a cordinate on mouse hover.
